	<h2>Are you getting all of the benefits from being a Veteran?</h2>
		<p>VET-Counts is a simple easy to use application that allows you to verfiy your service, and then
	 recieve those all important discounts that you have earned for your service.</p>
	<h2>How does it work?</h2>
	 	<p>Once verified thru the VET-Counts app, you will <strong>NEVER</strong> have to
	show your service connected identification ever again! All you do is flash the
	VET-Counts app home screen, and you save!! Additionally, with notifications enabled,
	we will notify you when discounts are available using your phone's GPS while checking out...
	so you never have to ask "do you offer discounts for veterans" we do it for you!!</p>
