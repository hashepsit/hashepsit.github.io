      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>VET-Counts is the brain child of Brandon Buchholz, a veteran himself. It was initially created during a coding workshop in Seattle with the help of three other web developers - Jacob Perez, Jon Knudtson and Charmaine Manganello. Buchholz understood how hard it was to find whether a store provides discounts for veterans and if it did, by how much. He wanted to make it easier for his fellow veterans and so VET-Counts was created.</p>

      <h2>The Goal</h2>
      <p>VET-Counts' primary goal is to help veterans. It's secondary goal is to find the best and available discounts at stores, restaurants and other services for veterans.</p>
